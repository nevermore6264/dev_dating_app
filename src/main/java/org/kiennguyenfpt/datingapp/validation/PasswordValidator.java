        $                 # end-of-string

        (?=.*[a-z])       # a lower case letter must occur at least once
        (?=.*[A-Z])       # an upper case letter must occur at least once
        (?=.*[@#$%^&+=])  # a special character must occur at least once
        (?=\S+$)          # no whitespace allowed in the entire string
        .{8,}             # anything, at least eight places though
        For example, the password "Abc@1234" is valid because it contains at least one digit, one lower case letter, one upper case letter, one special character, and has a length of at least 8 characters.
